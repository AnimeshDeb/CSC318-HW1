    <p><em><strong>Atif Aslam</strong></em> was born on March 12, 1983 in the country of Pakistan.
        In the years before college, his main goal was to become a Computer Science
        major despite his growing ambition to be a singer. The opportunity
        to showcase his talent came to him when he enered Punjab Colleges in India.
        Then in 2004, he created a college band, known as Jal, and his voice started to
        become well known. The following years saw him publish group albums as well
        as solo albums, which furthered his popularity. After Jal disbanded in 2008,
        Atif Aslam got the chance to voice the songs in Indian films, from which
        his career as a singer professionally started.

    <p><em><strong>Pritam Chakraborty</strong></em> was born on June 14th, 1971 to his parents Anuradha
    Chakraborty and Prabodh Chakraborty. His father, Prabodh Chakraborty, taught 
    him how to play guitar and sing songs. He also went to St. James' School and 
    later earned a Bachelor's in geology from Presidency College. Unlike Arijit Singh
    and Atif Aslam, he didn't immediately focus on beginning a singing career after college.
    Instead, he joined the Film and Television Institute of India in 1994 from where he learned
    about sound and broadcasting. Then in 1997, he moved to Mumbai, the financial, commercial,
    and the entertainment capital of India. He began creating short musical ads for various companies and using
    growing popularity in the early 2000s, he started to do songs in Indian movies. From there,
    like with Singh and Aslam, his name became well known and became one of the leading 
    artists of modern India.

    <h2>Why is Arijit Singh Interesting:</h2>
    <p><em><strong>Arijit Singh</strong></em> is one of the top Indian pop singers residing in India. From a very early age,
        he started learning how to sing from his mother, who was proficient in traditional indian music. 
    He also learned Indian music from his relatives, one of them was his uncle
who knew how to play the Tabla, a two handed drum. Throughout the years leading up to his teens, he 
was taught under a variety of music teachers. Two such teachers were Rajendra Prasad Hazari and Dhirendra Prasad
Hazari, the former taught Singh Indian classical music and the latter taught him how to play the Tabla.
Then in 2005, Singh started his music career via a singing competition -Fame Gurukul. Although he
didn't win first place in the singing competition, his voice nevertheless mesmerized the audience who heard it.
However, as he strived to improve, he got the chance to voice songs in different Indian movies, leaving
his first mark on India. From then on, he has composed and sang a multitude of songs. Adding on to his sincere
upbringing, Airjit Singh is especially known for his humble appearance and kindness towards everyone, and especially his fans.
Considering all of what I talked about, I favor Arijit Singh highly because his songs are soulful and always give me the energy
to continue following my passion.
